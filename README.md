Just set your WOW directory, select your character and export/import the game settings. To share your interface, just send the ZIP file.

**Download**: [WoWZiport-v1.1.zip](https://github.com/kursion/wowziport/raw/master/dist/WoWZiport-v1.1.zip)

*NOTE: When importing settings, it will automatically create a backup of the settings and the AddOns. Therefore, it will be easy for you to restore the previous state of the game settings.*
